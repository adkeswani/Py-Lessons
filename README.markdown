# Intro to Python and Intro to Pygame Workshops

## List of lessons

The breakdown file has a breakdown of the lessons. 

## Structure for each lesson

Each lesson will be in a separate directory containing the following:

- covered: Contains what was covered in the previous lesson (good for a very quick review) and what will be covered in this one
- plan: Contains a plan for the lesson, including what to explain, what questions to ask and eventually, what exercises to give
- Any other files required for the lesson

## Time available

Each day will go from 10AM to 4PM. Let's say we break for 45 mins at 12:30PM. That gives us 5:15, so with 15 mins buffer, that gives 5:00.

## Todo

- Email Brad:
 - Get room booked
 - Get front entrance door to allow access on both mornings
 - Get lunch organised
 - See if he'll give us a case of beer in return for the work
- Organise BBQ or something for volunteers for after the workshop
