# Intro to Python and Intro to Pygame Workshops

## List of lessons

The Py-Lessons.mm file has a breakdown of the lessons. Use Freemind from [freemind.sourceforge.net/](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/) to open it.

## Structure for each lesson

Each lesson will be in a separate directory containing the following:
- COVERED: Contains what was covered in the previous lesson (good for a very quick review) and what will be covered in this one
- PLAN: Contains a plan for the lesson, including what to explain, what questions to ask and eventually, what exercises to give
- Any other files required for the lesson

## Time available

Each day will go from 10AM to 4PM. Let's say we break for 45 mins at 12:30PM. That gives us 5:15, with maybe 45 minutes for shit happens or constipation (things taking longer than they should...). That leaves 4:30 hours for the lessons in total.
