- *Open ship.py*
    - update, bounces

- *Open game.py*

- Creating a sprite group:
    - Group sprites, power of sprites
    - constructor, add sprites

- Displaying a sprite group:
    - clear, efficiency vs. full screen
    - update, calls for all
    - draw == blit, returns rects
    - display.update, takes rects
    - remember this process, speed

- *Run game.py*

Experiments:
    - Add another 9 ship sprites between the existing 10, that start at a different y value using a for loop
    - Mini game:
        - Create 2 sprite groups, one that will just have the player's ship, one that will have a bunch of those star objects we made earlier
        - Get the keyboard or mouse movement code back in
        - Get the star objects bouncing around, create 10 of them
        - Use our new efficient display methods to display the 2 sprite groups
        - Add a Bullet Sprite that fires whenever user presses spacebar or something, use the bullet.png file

- Show off what you've done!
