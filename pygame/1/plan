- Loading images
    - Pygame lets you load images onto surfaces and supports a couple of types of transparency
    - *Open loader.py*
    - Loader contains a method for loading images that you can copy and reuse in almost any project
    - Takes 2 arguments, the first of which is filename, second I'll explain shortly
    - It then gets the full path to the image, assumes that they are in an images subdirectory using a usual os path join method
    - To load the image, we just use pygame.image.load with the full path to the image
    - It's inside a try-catch in case the image doesn't exist
    - pygame.image.load returns a surface, so we could just return and use this, but we would like to use transparency

    - The first type of transparency supported is called per-pixel alpha
    - Here, each pixel has a 4th value besides RGB, called the alpha 
    - This is how transparent that pixel is, ranges from 0 to 255, where 255 is opaque, 0 is invisible
    - When you design the image you can make things transparent/semi-transparent and that info gets saved into this alpha channel
    - Not all formats support it, but I know png files do support it and jpegs don't
    - Then we call convert_alpha() on it. This is like convert() which was to convert to the fastest possible pixel format, but it retains the alpha channel while convert() doesn't
    - *Demo image!*

    - The second type of transparency is called colorkey transparency
    - Here we choose 1 color on the image we want to make fully transparent
    - Is this faster than per-pixel?
    - The second argument of load_image takes this color
    - Then at the bottom of load_image, we use set_colorkey to set that as the transparent colour
    - We also pass a flag RLEACCEL, which accelerates for software surfaces
    - Alternatively, we can pass -1 as the colorkey and it uses the color from the top-left pixel of the image

    - Colorkey
    - Drawing them to screen
    - Exercise/demos:
        - Get background on
        - A colorkey example?
        - Exercise???
