- *Open ship.py*

- Input:
    - key.get_pressed(), list bools all keys, constants from docs, here
    - mouse.get_pos(), tan inv, *draw diagram*

- Experiments:
    - Set up the keys so that left arrow and right arrow rotate, up arrow and down arrow move forwards and backwards
    - Get rid of that, set up so that rotating mouse rotates ship, and clicking left and right buttons moves forwards and backwards
        - Will need docs to see how to check mouse buttons
    - Add momentum
