- Types are classes:
    - Going to look at Python's built-in data types, incl. more detail about ones you know and some new ones
    - Before we do that, will first explain an important concept
    - *Open interpreter, use the float is_integer() method on a float*
    - What's going on here? Calling a method from a floating point number?
    - Turns out that all values including integers, Booleans are objects as well
    - *Demonstrate type(x) built-in on float*
    - And the type of a value is actually its class
    - *Demonstrate dir(x) on float*
    - Remember that dir() shows us all attributes and methods, here are a float's
    - The other types also have methods like is_integer, will see them as we go through the types

- Basic types:
    - *Open http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html*
    - Python website has documentation for most things, incl. built-in types
    - Booleans:
        - Already seen these
        - Useful info, if anything is 0 or empty, is considered False, useful in conditions for ifs and loops
    - Numeric types:
        - We've seen integers and floats
        - Here we see the operations available, abs gives you absolute value
        - Can also convert things into these numeric types, e.g. int("5"), int(5.0) give 5, same for float
        - Python also has complex numbers, can create using complex(re, im)
        - Note 1 is important, integer division always gives an integer and rounds towards -infinity, common mistake to expect a float
            - // does the same, but for other types, will not necessarily return integer though
        - Also have bit operations on integers, do you know how an integer can be represented as bits? Does operations on these bits
        - Then there are some extra methods that numeric types have, can read through later

- Sequence types - lists:
    - Will skip over some types and move onto sequence types
    - Obviously store sequences of data
    - *Open interpreter, demonstrate creating a list of assorted types incl. another list*
    - Start with lists, to create a list, just put comma-separated items between square brackets
    - As you can see, stores multiple types at same time
    - To access items, can use list[index], where 0 is first element
    - To get length of list use len(list)
    - Again, as objects, lists have other methods, *demonstrate, create 2 lists, consult stdtypes page*
        - Append, adds object in brackets to end of list as a single item, even if it's a sequence
        - Extend, adds items from a sequence in brackets to end of list
        - Count, number of occurrences
        - Index, where it occcurs (optionally between i and j)
        - Insert, puts item in at specified index
        - Remove, just deletes element at given index
        - Pop, deletes the element at the index and returns it to you. No argument pops last element
        - Reverse, obvious
        - Sort, sorts the list in place, i.e. doesn't return a new list, alters this one, will talk more about this later
    - So lists are quite versatile, if you're used to arrays then lists make things a lot easier

- in keyword, for loops and while loops
    - Now that we have lists, we can use some more keywords and control structures 

    - Sequences support the in keyword
    - This returns a boolean, whether or not a given item is in the sequence
    - *Demonstrate with no spoon example*
    - Also, normally we'd use "not a in b", but Python gives use "a not in b" to sound more English-like

    - Finally we get loops, starting with for loop
    - Different to how it's used in other languages, usually have a counter, runs the loop N times
    - Python uses for loop to loop, or iterate, through sequences and other iterable objects
    - Syntax, *demonstrate with squarer.py*:
        - for keyword, variable, in keyword, sequence, then usual colon and indent
        - Goes through sequence from beginning to end and the variable contains the current object
        - No need for any variable++ or next keyword at the end
        - Works on sequences, so strings, lists, tuples, this means they are "iterable", later will talk about making other objects iterable

    - Can also get the traditional for loop using range, briefly saw in invaders exercise
    - range can return lists of consecutive numbers, *demonstrate just a range call*
    - Can use this in for loops by putting range(N) as the sequence, N == number of times to loop
    - *Demonstrate using stringmult.py*
    - Will loop from 0 to N - 1, N times, and variable contains the current loop number
    - Range also lets you do more complicated sequences:
        - *Demonstrate range(start, end)*
        - *Demonstrate range(start, end, step)*
    
    - while loops are similar to those in other languages, while keyword then condition, *demonstrate with printpop*
    - Very similar to if statements, no brackets needed, needs the colon and indent
    - Note how we use the feature that an empty list is considered false
   
- Exercise 3a:
    - Then exercise with sorts
        - Graphical using pygame
        - After each step it returns the list in its next form
        - OK, will do
        - Use a stub that just returns a range
        - Will subclass to get different sorts
        - Give people each a different one
        - Make the constructor take in a list, but get them to create it using shuffle
        - May want to test on its own, on a smaller list first

- More sequence types - tuples and strings
    - Another sequence type is the tuple, *demonstrate, try and change it too*
    - Similar to lists, store sequences of any types, but constructed using () and items cannot be added/replaced/removed from it
    - None of the methods to change a list apply, *demonstrate*, but can still read its elements, count occurrences, etc., *demonstrate*
    - Note: although you can't remove/add/replace items in tuples, the internal parts of these items can still be changed, *demonstrate on a list*
    - Can construct without brackets, *demonstrate* but sometimes necessary to ensure it's understood as a tuple (e.g. nesting a tuple inside a tuple)

    - Tuples used where you want some sort of structure, e.g. (page number, line number), (x, y, z) which wouldn't make as much sense with a list
    - Meanwhile, when you know you're going to be adding/removing items, e.g. all of enemies visible on screen, then use a list

    - We've seen how to construct lists and tuples
    - It's also possible to take them apart, known as unpacking
    - *Demonstrate: x, y, z = t and [x, y, z] = l
    - This is commonly used in return values, *demonstrate with unpacking.py*

    - Can use some operators on sequences
    - *Demonstrate + and * *
    - + returns a new list where 1st extended by 2nd, * returns a new list where original is repeated N times
    - TODO: EQUALITY??

    - Can also convert things into lists and tuples, so like int(), there is list() and tuple()
    - Can use to convert between lists and tuples, or can pass in other sequences like strings

    - Strings are also a sequence type, a sequence of characters
    - They use the "" or '' constructor instead
    - Like tuples, they cannot be changed, *demonstrate*, and have the same methods, *demonstrate count, +, *, index*
    - Escape characters?
    - str()
    - Strings have a lot of special methods, *show http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html*

- Dictionaries
    - *Ask what a dictionary is*. Gives words and their meanings, it is a "mapping" from words to their meanings
    - *Draw diagram showing a mapping*
    - Dictionaries in Python are similar, but allow you to map any type of object to any other type of object
    - Syntax, *demonstrate in interpreter*
        - Curly brackets, then a comma-separated list of pairs, where a pair has an object, then a colon, then another object
    - Left object is key, right object is value, together called a key-value pair
    - Like words in a real dictionary, you look up the key to get the value, so in a real dictionary keys are words, values are their meanings
    - But here the key and value can be of any type, we could use a Vehicle if we wanted to
    - *Open http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html*, shows methods for dictionaries, e.g. *demonstrate in interpreter*:
        - Other ways to construct a dictionary
        - Can get the number of key-value pairs with len
        - To access an item, looks like a list, [], but use key rather than index, this is used to retrieve and also add items to a dictionary
        - in and not in still work to see if a key exists
        - pop(key) is like pop on a list, removes key-value pair with the specified key and returns the value
        - items() returns a list of key-value pairs, each as a tuple, keys() returns list of keys, values() returns list of values
            - Show items() note, order of items is not same as they were inserted
            - Common thing is to, for loop, sorted keys, lalala

- Exercise 3b:
    - Going to use dictionaries to implement a simple substitution cipher
    - In this cipher, the 26 lower case letters will be mapped to the same 26 letters shuffled
    - To encode, replace letter with the one it is mapped to, to decode, the reverse
    - Punctuation and whitespace will be left the same encoded or decoded
    - You will write the SubCipher class, its constructor will take 2 lists, the original letters and the letters they map to
    - Will have an encode and decode method that take a string and return the encoded/decoded string
    - This is in the subcipher.py file. Also, change the call to the constructor so the 2nd list is randomly shuffled
    - I recommend using 2 dictionaries and for loops, will also need to account for punctuation
